Python has appliations in pretty much every field of programming and software development. But since we are mainly interested in using it as a tool for data handling let's do a mini data-science project to get an idea of some more data-specific Python capabilities. Here the goal is to be able to load a data-set efficiently and do some nice visualizations. \n",
